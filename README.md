7. Each cell will have the properties `data-month`, `data-year`, `data-temp` containing their corresponding month, year, and temperature values.
   
8. The `data-month`, `data-year` of each cell should be within the range of the data.
   
9.  The heat map should have cells that align with the corresponding month on the y-axis.
    
10. The heat map should have cells that align with the corresponding year on the x-axis.
    
11. The heat map should have multiple tick labels on the y-axis with the full month name.
    
12. The heat map should have multiple tick labels on the x-axis with the years between 1754 and 2015.
    
13. The heat map should have a legend with a corresponding `id="legend"`.
    
14. The legend should contain `rect` elements.

15. The `rect` elements in the legend should use at least 4 different fill colors.
    
16. When moused over an area and there is a tooltip with a corresponding `id="tooltip"` which displays more information about the area.
    
17. The tooltip should have a `data-year` property that corresponds to the `data-year` of the active area.

1. Navigate to `heat-map`
2. `sass` should be installed
3. Run to reflect changes made to scss:
    `sass src/css/style.scss css/style.css`
