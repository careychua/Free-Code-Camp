8. The bar elements' `data-date` properties should match the order of the provided data.
   
9.  The bar elements' `data-gdp` properties should match the order of the provided data.
    
10. Each bar element's height should accurately represent the data's corresponding GDP.
    
11. The `data-date` attribute and its corresponding bar element should align with the corresponding value on the x-axis.
    
12. The `data-gdp` attribute and its corresponding bar element should align with the corresponding value on the y-axis.
    
13. Whwn an area is moused over, a tooltip with a corresponding `id="tooltip"` which displays more information about the area.
