## JavaScript: Caesars Cipher

---

## [Project Requirements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/caesars-cipher)
1. The letters are shifted by some set amount.

2. A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. 

3. Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

4. All letters will be uppercase. 

5. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.
