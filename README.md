# Free Code Camp Project
## Palindrome Checker

---

## [Project Requirements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/palindrome-checker)
1. Return ```true``` if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return ```false```.

2. A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

3. Need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.
