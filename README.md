## [Project Requirements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer)
1. There is a ```textarea``` element with a corresponding ```id="editor"```.
2. There is an element with a corresponding ```id="preview"```.
3. When text is entered into the ```#editor``` element, the ```#preview``` element is updated  to display the content of the textarea.
4. When GitHub flavored markdown is entered into the ```#editor``` element, the text is rendered as HTML in the ```#preview``` element.
5. When the markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the ```#editor``` field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.
6. When the markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the ```#editor``` field should be rendered as HTML in the ```#preview``` element.
7. The markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as ```br``` (line break) elements.
